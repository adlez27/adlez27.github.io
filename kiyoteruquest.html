        <p class="center light">Every year on April 10th, we're invited to visit Kiyoteru's elementary school. For the fandom, this is another opportunity to celebrate Kiyoteru. So for Open House 2019, we plan to release a collaboration album with videos for every song.

        Please fill out the signup form by October 31 to join!
        <br><br>
        Depending on the number of people signing up for each role, you may have to work on more than one song for the album. To make sure you aren't given too much, the form asks for a reasonable maximum you can contribute.

            <h5 class="center indigo-text text-accent-4">Musician</h5>
            <p class="light">Musicians will be composing instrumental tracks and mixing their individual songs. Mastering of the whole album will be handled by DystoP.
            <br><br>
            If you plan to write lyrics for your own song, don't forget to sign up as a lyricist too!
            <br><br>
            You can join even if you don't own Vocaloid at all. If you own a vocaloid other than Kiyoteru, you're free to set up a VSQx file yourself. If you own any Kiyoteru voicebank, please make sure to sign up as a tuner.</p>

            <h5 class="center indigo-text text-accent-4">Lyricist</h5>
            <p class="light">Lyricists will write lyrics to go with the instrumental track being composed by a musician. <br><br>
            The language of the lyrics depends on what you're comfortable writing and what the tuner can handle.
            <br><br>
            The melody of the song can either be composed by the musician or composed by the lyricist. If you own Vocaloid, you're free to input lyrics using that.</p>

            <p class="light">Tuners will tune and render Kiyoteru in Vocaloid.
            <br><br>
            You must own at least one Kiyoteru voicebank (V2, V4Natural, V4Rock) We are planning to contact AHS about selling the album, so if you only have the trial version, please purchase it before joining.
            <br><br>
            Being able to make Kiyoteru sing languages other than Japanese is a great bonus!</p>

            <p class="light">Artists will create individual square track artwork for each song, as well as artwork assets for music videos.
            <br><br>
            The assets required (characters, backgrounds, etc.) depends on style of video being made.
            <br><br>
            If you are interested in making the video yourself, sign up as a video editor.</p>

            <br><br>Please be familiar with the style of vocaloid videos or chorus battle videos!
            <br><br>You can work with your existing skillset, so don't worry if you're not familiar with complex techniques yet.</p>
